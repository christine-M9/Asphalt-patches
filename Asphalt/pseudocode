Function potholePatchCounter(S):
    Initialize patches to 0
    Initialize N to length of S
    Initialize index i to 0

    for i < N:
        If S[i] is 'X':
            Increment patches by 1
            Increment i by 2 because they will be patched together along with the current segment containing the pothole.
        Increment i by 1

    Return patches
